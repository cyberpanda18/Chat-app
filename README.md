# Chat-app
This is a stupid chat app, with no amazing UI or CSS, just a basic send text to yourself kinda stuff. I have made this to learn Socket.io and Node.js.
I will be making a better one soon.
Stay tuned!!

Run all these commands in terminal before cloning

1) npm install --save express nodemon socket.io
2) npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-0

Make sure your babelrc file and package.json file looks exactly the same.
Type node app.js or npm run start to run the file.
